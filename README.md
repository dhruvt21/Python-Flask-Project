# Your-Thoughts-Website

A website for publishing articles which uses flask micro web framework for backend and mysql for database.

To run the application you can either use the flask command or pythonâ€™s -m switch with Flask. Before you can do that you need to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the FLASK_APP environment variable:

On Linux -

> export FLASK_APP=hello.py
> flask run

On Windows -

> C:\path\to\app>set FLASK_APP=hello.py
> flask run

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
